"""_edit_grants.py — session-scoped, per-folder consent gate for tools that
can overwrite an EXISTING file's content: edit() (always) and write_file()
(only when overwrite=true AND the target already exists — creating a brand
new file never needs a grant). bash/python_exec were explicitly scoped OUT of
this gate by the user on 2026-08-26 despite being able to write files via
shell redirection — a known, accepted gap, not an oversight. The two entry
points share ONE registry: granting a folder through either tool covers both,
since the thing being consented to is "existing files in this folder may be
modified," not a specific tool name. Default is OFF: no folder may be touched
until granted, once per server process lifetime (this IS "the session" —
there is no other process boundary an MCP stdio server can observe).

Trust model — read before changing anything here: there is no OS-level
dialog and no local file the human edits directly; the only channel back to
the actual computer owner is the same chat ChatGPT is already having with
them. So the gate is a two-call protocol: the first qualifying call against a
not-yet-granted folder always fails and returns a fresh, single-use nonce,
with an explicit instruction that the model must ask the user directly and
only pass the nonce back once they've said yes THIS turn — never
speculatively. This does not cryptographically prove a human approved it; it
forces one extra explicit round-trip per folder and leaves an audit trail
(see logs/agent_activity.jsonl via the existing @_logged wrapper on both).
That is the strongest guarantee achievable without a second UI surface —
know this ceiling before relying on it for anything higher-stakes.
